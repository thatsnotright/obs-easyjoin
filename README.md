# About

This project aims to understand and prototype a WebExtension (the goal) which can be installed in a users browser and enables the user a quick way to connect to an existing OBS WebRTC session.

The goal is that a user who has set up OBS to stream can easily join that live stream with their browser via either webcam or screen/tab sharing without understanding IPs and all of the other challenges.
